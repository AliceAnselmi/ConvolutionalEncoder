# Convolutional Encoder
This project was realized as final test for the *Digital Logic Design* (Italian equivalent: *Reti Logiche*)
course as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Politecnico di Milano.

## Design specification
The VHDL program is required to implement a convolutional algorithm. The hardware module has to
serialize a flow of 8-bit words and then apply a convolutional algorithm with transmission rate 1/2 on it,
producing a continuous stream of bits.
See *project_task.pdf" for details.
